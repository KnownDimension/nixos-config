# my nixos config

it isnt perfect, it isnt genius, but its mine

## profiles

genesis is my main PC, an i7 3820 from 2012 paired with a vega 56, works well for years and can still play games

zerotwo was my failed attempt at getting linux on a Samsung laptop with the worst bios man can summon, attempting to use linux on it has been a pain with random suspends and non functioning HW acceleration (intel gpu and cpu btw), i may work on it someday but not now
